# Borehole Viewer

3D visualization of Deep Borehole Concept (DBC) repositories for disposal of Disused Sealed Radioactive Sources (DSRS) employing available open-source 3D modeling and computer graphics technology.

## Getting started

This project is under development. To run and test the software, it is needed to have installed the latest version of Godot Engine. All source files are located in the `src` directory.

### Technologies

To develop this application, the following tools and technologies are being used:

- [Blender 3D](https://blender.org/): open-source 3D modeling and video editing software.
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/): open-source game engine.

## Background

Sealed Radioactive Sources (SRSs) are widely employed in several fields for the benefit and profit of humanity. Like all radioactive materials, they have a working life-span determined by the half-life of their radionuclides, during which they remain economically viable. After this period, SRSs must be appropriately treated and disposed of as radioactive waste.

A reliable disposal method endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the Deep Borehole Concept (DBC) repository. This consists of a narrow vertical well drilled into a selected host site, where SRSs are stored in standardized steel containers. These containers stack up from the bottom of the borehole to a safe disposal depth.

This project aims to create a computational tool for the 3D dynamic and interactive visualization of DBC repository characteristics, features, events, and processes. The tool is designed to facilitate the general public's understanding of radioactive waste management and to aid in the licensing process for the construction of such facilities.
